A brief introduction of USTC----If you're eager for a place to explore the mystery of science and technology, then I think USTC is the best choice for you. Founded in 1958, USTC aimed to train scientific and technological talents for China's newly-developing subjects. Travelling more than sixty years, USTC gathered a large amount of scientists, Yan Jici, Hua Luogeng and Qian Xuesen for instance, and created original policies for education and teaching, like founding graduate school and special classes for the gifted young, which all contributed a lot of students with solid theoretical foundation and great problems resolution capabilities for our society and country. Nowadays, USTC is known for frontier science and high-tech worldwide, and is also a super-excellent place for those who wants to devote his/her life in scientific research or technology developing. In the near future, USTC will also broaden its eyes on new medical research, special management science and unique humanities subjects, while sticking to the motto of "Virtue with Veritas, Mind with Hand", making best effort to nurture more talents for our nation's construction.
