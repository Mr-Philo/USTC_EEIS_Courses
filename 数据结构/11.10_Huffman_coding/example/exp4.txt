  There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want topick them from your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream;gowhere you want to go;be what you want to be,because you have only one life andone chance to do all the things you want to do.
  May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,enough trials to make youstrong,enough sorrow to keep you human,enough hope to make you happy? Always putyourself in others¡¯shoes.If you feel that it hurts you,it probably hurts theother person, too.    
  The happiest of people don¡¯t necessarily have the best of everything;they justmake the most of everything that comes along their way.Happiness lies for thosewho cry,those who hurt, those who have searched,and those who have tried,for onlythey can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.Love begins with a smile,grows with a kiss andends with a tear.The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past,you can¡¯t go on well in lifeuntil you let go of your past failures and heartaches.
  When you were born,you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Liveyour life so that when you die,you're the one who is smiling and everyone aroundyou is crying.
  Please send this message to those people who mean something to you,to those who have touched your life in one way or another,to those who make you smile whenyou really need it,to those that make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down,to those who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship.And if you don¡¯t, don¡¯t worry,nothing bad will happen to you,youwill just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone¡®s day with this message.
